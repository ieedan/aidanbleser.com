title: shadcn/ui might not be for you
description: Why I use shadcn/ui and why you maybe shouldn't.

I am an avid user and contributor to [shadcn-svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com) and a firm believer in it's methodology. Over my time as a user and contributor I have learned a lot about `shadcn/ui` and its community.

I use `shadcn/ui` because I want control of the code. I want to be able to change the styles and behavior as I see fit, and I don't want to wait on anyone else to make my app work.

Unfortunately many of the developers using `shadcn/ui` don't share this mindset, most of them won't touch the code once it's in their project. Many an issue have been opened to change this or that missing the point that this change should simply be made to the code in their own project.

I think most developers expect a batteries included experience which isn't really what's being offered. What's being offered is a set of primitives that solve most of the hard parts with the expectation that you are capable of solving the rest.

This is why `shadcn/ui` might not be for you. It may be too much to ask to write the rest of the components you may need for an application, or to look at the code from time to time and if that's the case it's probably time to find something else.
