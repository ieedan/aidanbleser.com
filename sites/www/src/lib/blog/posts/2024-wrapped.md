Last december I recounted my journey as a developer in 2023 you can see that post [here](https://aidanbleser.com/blog/posts/My%202023%20Web%20Development%20Wrapped). Looking back on that post it's pretty incredible to see how things have changed and stayed the same.

Lets start by talking about where I started this year (the end of last years post):

**Front-End**

- Svelte(kit)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

**Back-End**

- C# .Net Core

I chose Svelte because I loved it's simplicity and how easy it was to move fast, TailwindCSS because really what else are you gonna use and TypeScript because duh.

On the backend I was using C# because it has an awesome experience for building APIs and I was familiar with the language.

Early this year I started a project called [geist-ui-svelte](https://geist-ui-svelte.dev). This was my best effort at a UI library with a similar style to the Vercel Geist design system. I used this for the rewrite of the CMMS I built for my company and it worked really well but then I discovered [shadcn-svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com).

## Discovering shadcn-svelte

**shadcn-svelte** was a revelation for me all the burden and problems caused by **geist-ui-svelte** could be solved by just owning the source in my own project.
